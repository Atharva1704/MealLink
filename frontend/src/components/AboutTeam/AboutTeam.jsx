              Welcome to Meal Link, a revolutionary platform that bridges the
              gap between hotels and NGOs to combat food waste and fight hunger.
              Our mission is to utilize the surplus food from hotels and
              distribute it to underprivileged individuals, ensuring that no
              meal goes to waste. At Meal Link, we understand the pressing issue
              of food waste and its detrimental impact on our society and the
              environment. Meanwhile, we also acknowledge the alarming number of
              people who struggle with hunger and malnutrition. To address this
              dual challenge, we have created an innovative online platform that
              seamlessly connects hotels and NGOs, fostering a collaborative
              effort to make a positive change.
